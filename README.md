# BIOS611-final-project
Hi, this is my BIOS 611 final project. The project aims to train a model to predict an individual is at high risk or low risk of a heart attack 
based on the input parameters including patientâ€™s socio-demographics, clinical  characteristics, lifestyle, and comorbidities.

Here is the project structure:

# Instructions on how to use the repo
First, build a docker image in the project directory with the Dockerfile. 
Second, run the Docker container and excute the Makefile to creat all the figures and tables saved in `output/`.
The main Python script is`main.py` and the souce codes are stored in `src/`. 
Third, use Latex to creat the final report with figures/tables inserted; you can find the Latex source file as `report.tex`. 
Final report compiled as `bios611_final_report.pdf` is saved under `final_project/`.
