# BIOS611-final-project
Hi, this is my BIOS 611 final project. The project aims to train a model to predict an individual is at high risk or low risk of a heart attack 
based on the input parameters including patientâ€™s socio-demographics, clinical  characteristics, lifestyle, and comorbidities.

Here is the project structure:
